## 💭 Reflection  

Answer briefly (1–2 paragraphs):

My testing approach was dynamic testing, where I interacted directly with the application by entering different types of inputs into the text field to observe how the system responded. This allowed me to validate the app’s behavior in real-time and identify issues with input handling.

I found it easy to spot when the field accepted unexpected values, as the results were immediate and visible. The main challenge was ensuring I tested a wide enough range of inputs to uncover edge cases. Overall, I feel very confident in identifying and reporting bugs, as I was able to detect validation issues effectively and clearly document their impact.
